# ðŸš‡ Metro Path Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project demonstrates one of the most powerful graph algorithms â€” **Dijkstra's Algorithm** â€” applied to the **Bengaluru Metro (Green & Purple Lines)**.  
It calculates the shortest path between any two metro stations.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
- The metro lines are represented as a **graph** using an adjacency matrix.  
- Each station is a **node** and each direct connection is an **edge**.  
- The program computes the **shortest path** from a given source station to:
  - **All other stations** (51 stations in total), or
  - A **specific destination** station.

---

## âš¡ Features
- Enter a **source station** â†’ see shortest paths to all stations.  
- Enter **source + destination** â†’ get the shortest route with the number of stations.  
- Clean and simple **web interface** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  
- Flexible, easy to use, and beginner-friendly.
